# Lab Outline:

Labs should always have **specs** that involves writing code to pass tests

##Examples

## Format of a Lab Readme
### `#` Title
The title comes first. It should be the name of the repository.

### `##` Objectives
Objectives Should immediately follow the title of the lab. Students should be able to readily find and define the skills they should be expected to practice or learn by completing the lab.

### `##` Introduction

The introduction should discuss the premise, or scenario of the lab. It should set the stage for the work the students will be doing. You don't need to title it as "Introduction." Feel free to be creative. 

### `##` Instructions

Instructions should be a numbered list of steps to take when solving the lab. This section can include a leading paragraph if its content does not fit into the numerical order (i.e. "After forking and cloning this lab, open the `*.xcworkspace` file.").
